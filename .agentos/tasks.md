# Tasks

## Now

- [ ] tasks.md § Now: mark items written before the checkpoint as superseded in `context` and in child-repo `status` ("Open tasks (Now)") (task id `unify-current-task-state`).

## Acceptance criteria

- After `agentos checkpoint --task <id> --next "<action>"`, `agentos status`, `agentos context <engine> --task <id>` and `agentos resume --task <id>` present exactly one current next action: the most recently saved one.
- Older or contradicting next-action text in handoff.md or tasks.md is not presented as current; the next agent can tell it is superseded.
- Nothing is silently deleted.

## Next

- [ ] Next-action truncation in the managed handoff block (300 characters) and `status` across several tasks: tracked separately.

## Later

- [ ] Body-text retrieval beyond Brain records: `brain search` and `decisions.md` section bodies (`context --about` covers Brain record bodies; the task id stays separate from the phrase).
- [ ] Make the default Obsidian layout expose the actual Brain records.
